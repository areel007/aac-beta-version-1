        <p>
          Situated in one of the most commercially vibrant regions in Nigeria,
          the Asaba International Airport is Nigeria’s fifth largest airport in terms of
          the number of passengers handled and goods transported.
          <br><br>
          The airport is situated in the city of Asaba which serves as the gateway to the South-east and South-south
          regions known for commerce, industries and oil & gas development – the geographic regions stretch
          from Benin City to Port Harcourt and including urban areas such as Onitsha, Nnewi, Aba, Warri etc with
          high population density, industrialisation and income-generation concentrations.
          <br><br>
          The Asaba International Airport was designed to guarantee civilians and economic operators an extensive
          network of links within Nigeria, with West/Central Africa and the rest of the world, thus contributing
          to the economic and social development of Delta State and the country as a whole.
          <br><br>
          AAC is currently renovating the airport terminal and upgrading requisite infrastructure to commence
          regional flights to other African countries with definite plans to extend to the rest of the world.
          <br><br>
          Our aim is to become Africa’s leading airport operators, with the most efficient and advanced levels
          of service for passengers and goods.
