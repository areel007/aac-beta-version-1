        Asaba Airport Company (AAC) is the concessionaire responsible for
        managing Asaba International Airport. It is an emerging airport operator
        in Nigeria for goods and passenger traffic.
      </p>

      <p class="text-black text-base mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
        AAC was established as a special purpose vehicle for concession to drive the turn-around
        management, operations, and maintenance of Asaba International Airport. The major objective
        of the concession is to foster the remodelling and deployment of requisite airport
        infrastructure with the singular goal of elevating air travel experience in the South-East and
        South-South corridor as well as serving as a regional hub for air trac movement connecting
        West and Central Africa.
      </p>

      <p class="text-black text-base mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
        Asaba Airport Company is member company of R28 Holdings, a growing private investment
        company created in Nigeria in 2007 and over the years secured and consolidated a diversified
        shareholding portfolio, with subsidiaries and investments cutting across a wide range of
        industries and asset classes in Construction, Real Estate Development, Oil & Gas, Energy &
        Infrastructure Services, Aviation, Manufacturing, Retail, and basic industry start-ups. R28
        currently is involved in stimulating and guiding the growth of its constituent companies.
      </p>

      <p class="text-black text-base mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
        The R28 has a long-term investment perspective and has grown organically through
        acquisitions and smart investments in identified growth companies. We are continuously
        identifying and developing profitable investment opportunities.
      </p>

      <p class="text-black text-base mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
        The consideration for the redevelopment and expansion of Asaba International Airport is
        hinged on the development of a well-planned cargo terminal and warehousing facilities to take
        advantage of the commercial and industrial cities of Onitsha and Nnewi on one hand, and the
        oil & gas producing region of the South-south states on the other. The certainty is that the
        passenger and cargo trac will continue to soar beyond forecast in line with optimal
        operations of the airport.
