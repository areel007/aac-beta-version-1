        Asaba International Airport is an airport serving Asaba, the capital of
        Delta State, Nigeria and its environs. The airport handles domestic
        services connecting the city to Nigeria's major metropolitan centres. It
        is managed by the Asaba Airport Company.
      </p>

      <p class="text-black text-base mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
        The Asaba International Airport is the fifth largest in Nigeria in terms of the number of
        passengers handled and goods transported.
      </p>

      <p class="text-black text-base mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
        The airport is situated in the city of Asaba which serves as the gateway to the South-east and
        South-south regions known for commerce, industries and oil & gas development – the
        geographic regions stretch from Benin City to Port Harcourt and including urban areas such as
        Onitsha, Nnewi, Aba, Warri etc with high population density, industrialisation and incomegeneration concentrations
      </p>

      <p class="text-black text-base mb-[10px] md:mb-[20px]">
        Built by the Delta State Government, the airport was opened with great expectations in 2013. In
        February 2021, Delta State government signed a 30-year concession agreement with the Asaba
        Airport Company (AAC), a consortium of private companies to manage and operate the airport.
        This partnership has started to yield dividend as the airport is steadily improving not just in
        infrastructure but general experience of the passengers flying through the airport
